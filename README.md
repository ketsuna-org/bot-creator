# Cardia Kexa

Cardia Kexa is a Flutter Application with a focus on everything. We create what we want, when we want.

This App doesn't rely on a particular backend or API. It is a collection of various features and functionalities that we find interesting and useful.
It is a playground for us to experiment with different technologies and frameworks, and to showcase our skills as developers.
We are constantly adding new features and improving existing ones, so stay tuned for updates!

## Features

- **Flutter**: The app is built using Flutter, a popular open-source UI software development toolkit created by Google. It allows for fast development and beautiful UIs.

- **Dart**: The programming language used for building the app. Dart is easy to learn and provides a modern programming experience.

- **SQLite**: The app uses SQLite for local data storage. SQLite is a lightweight, serverless database engine that is perfect for mobile applications.

## Installation

## Confidentiality

This project does not collect or store any personal data. All data is stored locally on the device using SQLite, and no data is sent to any external servers or APIs.
The app does not require any special permissions.

We need to connect to Google Drive API to store User data, but this is not implemented yet. The app is designed to be used online and offline, but the online features are not fully implemented yet.
The app use Nyxx to connect to Discord API.

We rely on Google drive to store Bot Tokens, Commands data and other sensitive informations, what's actually used is only your Google Drive account, and the app will ask you to connect to your Google Drive account when you first run the "backup" feature.
